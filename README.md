# 🚨 AI Phishing Detector - Autonomous Agent

An AI-powered phishing detection system that uses Claude AI as an autonomous agent to identify and classify sophisticated phishing attacks in real-time.

---

## 🎯 Overview

This system leverages Claude AI's agentic capabilities through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to autonomously analyze emails, decide when to use external threat intelligence tools, and provide comprehensive security assessments.

Unlike traditional rule-based systems, the AI agent makes intelligent decisions about when and how to investigate suspicious emails, adapting its approach based on the content it encounters.

---

## 🔴 The Problem

Modern phishing attacks are increasingly sophisticated:

- **1,003,924 phishing attacks** recorded in Q1 2025 (Anti-Phishing Working Group)
- **3.4 billion phishing emails** sent daily worldwide
- **90%+ of successful cyberattacks** start with phishing emails

Traditional defenses fail because:
- Rule-based systems can't adapt to new patterns
- Basic ML models lack contextual understanding
- Manual analysis doesn't scale and is too slow
- Minutes matter in preventing damage

Organizations need a system that thinks like a security analyst, operates 24/7, and leverages real-time threat intelligence.

## ✅ The Solution: Autonomous AI Agent

This implementation uses Claude AI as an autonomous agent that:

1. **Analyzes emails** using natural language understanding
2. **Decides independently** when to check external threat databases
3. **Synthesizes findings** from multiple sources
4. **Provides explainable recommendations** with full reasoning
5. **Operates continuously** without human intervention

## 🤖 How the Agent Works

### Step 1: Email Monitoring (Schedule Trigger + Gmail)

**Trigger**: Every 5 minutes  
**Action**: Gmail node fetches unread messages  
**Output**: Structured email data (from, subject, body, headers)

---

### Step 2: Autonomous AI Agent Analysis

This is where the magic happens. The **AI Agent node** gives Claude access to tools and lets it decide how to investigate.

#### Tool Available to Agent

**Tool Name**: `check_virustotal`  
**Description**: Check if a domain is malicious using VirusTotal API  
**Parameters**: 
- `domain` (string): Domain to check (e.g., "suspicious-site.com")

**Returns**: VirusTotal analysis including:
- Malicious detections (X/95 engines)
- Reputation score
- Categories (phishing, malware, etc.)

#### Agent Decision Process

The AI Agent receives the email and autonomously decides:

1. **Initial Analysis**
   - Reads email content, sender, subject
   - Identifies phishing indicators (urgency, suspicious links, typosquatting)
   - Extracts any URLs or domains present
   - Calculates preliminary threat score

2. **Tool Use Decision**
   - **If URLs found AND suspicious**: Calls `check_virustotal` tool
   - **If no URLs OR clearly legitimate**: Skips external check
   - Agent makes this decision based on context, not hardcoded rules

3. **Tool Execution**
   - n8n executes the VirusTotal API call
   - Results returned to the agent
   - Agent can call the tool multiple times if multiple domains present

4. **Final Synthesis**
   - Combines initial analysis with VirusTotal data
   - Updates threat score based on external intelligence
   - Provides final recommendation: **ALLOW** / **QUARANTINE** / **BLOCK**
   - Includes detailed reasoning for the decision

#### Example Agent Flow

**Email Received**:
```
From: security@paypa1-verify.com
Subject: URGENT: Verify Your Account
Body: Click here immediately: https://paypa1-verify.com/confirm
```

**Agent Reasoning**:
```
1. Initial Analysis:
   - Typosquatting detected: "paypa1" vs "paypal"
   - Urgency tactics: "URGENT", "immediately"
   - Suspicious domain: paypa1-verify.com
   - Preliminary Score: 85/100 (HIGH RISK)

2. Decision: I need external validation on this domain
   → Calling check_virustotal("paypa1-verify.com")

3. VirusTotal Results:
   - 12/95 engines flag as malicious
   - Categories: phishing, social engineering
   - Recently registered domain

4. Final Assessment:
   - Updated Score: 98/100 (CRITICAL)
   - Recommendation: BLOCK IMMEDIATELY
   - Reasoning: Multiple phishing indicators + confirmed 
     malicious by external engines
```

### Step 3: Parallel Analysis (Anthropic Chat Model)

**Purpose**: Additional contextual analysis  
**Function**: Provides secondary evaluation of email characteristics  
**Output**: Supplementary insights fed to final report

This runs in parallel with the AI Agent's VirusTotal check to maximize efficiency.

---

### Step 4: Report Generation (JavaScript)

**Purpose**: Format findings into human-readable threat report  
**Function**: 
- Consolidates AI Agent findings
- Structures data (threat score, verdict, reasoning)
- Formats as HTML/text for email alert

**Example Output**:
```
🚨 PHISHING ALERT - CRITICAL THREAT DETECTED

Email: "URGENT: Verify Your Account"
From: security@paypa1-verify.com
Threat Score: 98/100

RECOMMENDATION: BLOCK IMMEDIATELY

Indicators:
✗ Typosquatting domain (paypa1)
✗ VirusTotal: 12/95 engines flag as malicious
✗ Urgency-based social engineering
✗ Recently registered domain

Full Analysis:
[Detailed reasoning from AI Agent]
```

---

### Step 5: SOC Alert (Gmail Send)

**Purpose**: Notify security team  
**Action**: Send consolidated report to SOC email  
**Contains**: 
- Threat score and verdict
- Original email details
- AI reasoning
- Recommended action

---

## 🔑 Key Advantages of This Approach

### 1. **True Autonomy**
The AI decides when to use tools, not hardcoded workflow logic. This means:
- Adapts to different email types dynamically
- Doesn't waste API calls on obvious legitimate emails
- Can handle new phishing tactics without workflow changes

### 2. **Context-Aware Intelligence**
Claude understands nuance:
- Distinguishes between "reset your password" from your bank vs. a scammer
- Considers sender reputation, email history, domain age
- Weighs multiple indicators together, not in isolation

### 3. **Explainable Decisions**
Every verdict includes:
- Step-by-step reasoning
- Which indicators triggered concern
- Why external tools were (or weren't) used
- Confidence level in the assessment

### 4. **Scalable and Extensible**
Adding new capabilities is simple:
- Add tool definitions (WHOIS, URLScan, etc.)
- AI automatically learns to use them
- No workflow restructuring needed

### 5. **Cost-Efficient**
- Only calls VirusTotal when necessary (AI's decision)
- Processes in ~8-15 seconds per email
- Minimal API usage compared to "check everything" approach
