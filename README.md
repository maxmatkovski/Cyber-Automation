# üß† DREAM Phishing Detector

## Overview  
**DREAM Phishing Detector** is an AI-powered phishing triage system designed to detect, analyze, and classify **nation-state‚Äìstyle spear-phishing attacks**.  
Built using **n8n** for orchestration and **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** for AI reasoning and tool use, it automatically enriches incoming emails, evaluates threat indicators, and produces a structured, auditable incident report for security teams.  

This project simulates a real-world SOC workflow for government and defense clients ‚Äî combining automated enrichment, LLM-driven analysis, and explainable decision logic to reduce analyst workload while maintaining full transparency.
