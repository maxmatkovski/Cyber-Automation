ðŸ§  DREAM Phishing Detector
Overview

DREAM Phishing Detector is an AI-powered phishing triage system designed to detect, analyze, and classify nation-stateâ€“style spear-phishing attacks.
Built using n8n for orchestration and MCP (Model Context Protocol) for AI reasoning and tool use, it automatically enriches incoming emails, evaluates threat indicators, and produces a structured, auditable incident report for security teams.

This project simulates a real-world SOC workflow for government and defense clients â€” combining automated enrichment, LLM-driven analysis, and explainable decision logic to reduce analyst workload while maintaining full transparency.
