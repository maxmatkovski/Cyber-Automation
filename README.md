## 🔴 The Problem

<img src="Images/image.png" alt="alt text" style="width:100%; height:150px; object-fit:cover;" />

### Current Challenges in Phishing Detection

Modern phishing attacks have evolved far beyond simple spam filters can handle:

1. **Sophisticated Social Engineering**: Attackers use personalized, context-aware messages that mimic legitimate communications
2. **Domain Spoofing**: Use of lookalike domains and compromised legitimate domains
3. **Zero-Day Threats**: New phishing campaigns with no prior threat intelligence
4. **Analyst Fatigue**: Security teams overwhelmed by false positives and manual triage
5. **Time-Sensitive Nature**: Phishing attacks require immediate response before damage occurs

### Traditional Detection Limitations

**Rule-Based Systems:**
- Cannot adapt to new attack patterns
- High false positive rates
- Require constant manual updating
- Miss sophisticated social engineering tactics

**Basic ML Models:**
- Lack contextual understanding
- Cannot explain decisions
- Require extensive labeled training data
- Struggle with novel attack vectors

**Manual Analysis:**
- Too slow for real-time threats
- Inconsistent between analysts
- Expensive and resource-intensive
- Cannot scale with email volume

### The Gap

Organizations need a system that:
- Understands context and intent (like a human analyst)
- Leverages real-time threat intelligence
- Makes explainable decisions
- Operates autonomously 24/7
- Adapts to new attack patterns

---

## ✅ The Solution

---

## 🔍 System Components

### Component 1: Schedule Trigger

**Purpose**: Initiates the workflow at regular intervals

**Configuration**:
- **Frequency**: Every 5 minutes
- **Type**: Time-based cron trigger

**Why This Matters**: Ensures near-real-time phishing detection without overwhelming the email API with constant requests.

---

### Component 2: Gmail - Get Many Messages

**Purpose**: Fetches unread emails from monitored mailbox

**Configuration**:
- **Operation**: `Get Many`
- **Filters**: `UNREAD` label only
- **Limit**: 10 emails per execution
- **Simplify**: Enabled (for cleaner data structure)

**Output Data Structure**:
```json
{
  "id": "email_id_here",
  "threadId": "thread_id",
  "subject": "Email Subject",
  "from": "sender@example.com",
  "text": "Email body content...",
  "snippet": "Preview of email...",
  "date": "2025-10-24T14:30:00Z",
  "labels": ["INBOX", "UNREAD"]
}
```

**Why This Matters**: Focuses analysis only on new, unseen emails, preventing duplicate processing and reducing API costs.

---

### Component 3: Basic LLM Chain (Initial Analysis)

**Purpose**: First-pass AI analysis to identify potential phishing indicators

**Model**: Anthropic Claude 4 Sonnet

**Prompt Template**:
```
You are an elite cybersecurity analyst for a government SOC. 
Analyze this email for nation-state phishing tactics.

EMAIL DATA:
From: {{ $json.from }}
Subject: {{ $json.subject }}
Date: {{ $json.date }}
Body: {{ $json.text || $json.snippet }}

ANALYSIS PROTOCOL:
1. Extract all URLs and domains
2. Identify social engineering tactics
3. Check for impersonation attempts
4. Look for urgency manipulation
5. Assess sender legitimacy
6. Calculate threat score (0-100)

Think step-by-step. Provide your assessment in JSON:
{
  "threatScore": 0-100,
  "riskLevel": "Low|Medium|High|Critical",
  "indicators": ["list", "of", "red", "flags"],
  "urls": ["extracted", "urls"],
  "recommendation": "Block|Quarantine|Allow",
  "explanation": "detailed reasoning"
}
```

**Output Example**:
```json
{
  "threatScore": 85,
  "riskLevel": "High",
  "indicators": [
    "Generic greeting 'Dear Valued Customer'",
    "Creates urgency with 24-hour deadline",
    "Suspicious domain mismatch",
    "Requests identity verification"
  ],
  "urls": ["https://suspicious-domain.com/verify"],
  "recommendation": "Block",
  "explanation": "Classic phishing indicators including urgency tactics..."
}
```

**Why This Works**:
- **Contextual Understanding**: Claude processes natural language with human-level comprehension
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies sophisticated social engineering tactics
- **URL Extraction**: Automatically finds malicious links even in obfuscated formats
- **Explainability**: Provides reasoning for every decision

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Used "government SOC" framing to encourage thorough analysis
- Requested step-by-step thinking for better reasoning
- Structured JSON output for programmatic processing
- Included confidence scoring for risk-based routing

---

### Component 4: IF Node (Decision Router)

**Purpose**: Routes emails based on initial threat assessment

**Configuration**:
- **Condition Type**: String Contains
- **Value 1**: `{{ $json.text }}`
- **Operation**: Contains
- **Value 2**: `"riskLevel": "HIGH"`

**Logic**:
```
IF email contains "HIGH" risk level:
    → TRUE branch (proceed to enrichment)
ELSE:
    → FALSE branch (low-risk, archive)
```

**Why String Matching?**:
The Claude response is wrapped in markdown code blocks (```json...```), so we parse by searching for the "HIGH" string rather than extracting the JSON field. This is simpler and more reliable for this workflow.

**Alternative Approaches Considered**:
- JSON parsing with regex: More fragile
- Threshold on numeric score: Required additional parsing
- Multiple conditions: Added unnecessary complexity

**Routing Outcomes**:
- **TRUE**: High/Critical risk → Continue to VirusTotal enrichment
- **FALSE**: Low/Medium risk → Could be archived, logged, or sent to different workflow

---

### Component 5: HTTP Request - VirusTotal

**Purpose**: External threat intelligence lookup for suspicious domains

**Configuration**:
- **Method**: GET
- **URL**: `https://www.virustotal.com/api/v3/domains/bensmith.com`
- **Authentication**: Header Auth
  - **Header Name**: `x-apikey`
  - **Header Value**: `[VirusTotal API Key]`
- **Send Headers**: Enabled

**API Response Structure**:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "bensmith.com",
    "type": "domain",
    "attributes": {
      "last_analysis_stats": {
        "harmless": 63,
        "malicious": 0,
        "suspicious": 0,
        "undetected": 32
      },
      "reputation": 0,
      "last_analysis_date": 1729785600,
      "creation_date": 852163200
    }
  }
}
```

**What VirusTotal Provides**:
- **Crowd-Sourced Intelligence**: Results from 95+ antivirus engines
- **Historical Data**: Domain age, registration info
- **Reputation Score**: Community-driven trust ratings
- **Real-Time Scanning**: Up-to-date threat status

**Why VirusTotal**:
- **Free Tier**: 4 requests/minute, 500/day (sufficient for demo)
- **High Accuracy**: Combines multiple detection engines
- **Well-Documented API**: Easy integration
- **Industry Standard**: Trusted by security professionals globally

**Limitations & Considerations**:
- **Rate Limits**: Free tier has request caps
- **False Negatives**: Very new domains may not be indexed
- **Privacy**: Queries are logged by VirusTotal
- **Production Alternative**: Could add WHOIS, URLScan.io, or internal threat feeds

---

### Component 6: Basic LLM Chain (Final Analysis)

**Purpose**: Re-evaluate threat with enriched VirusTotal data

**Model**: Anthropic Claude 4 Sonnet

**Prompt Template**:
```
You previously analyzed an email and found it HIGH RISK.

Now we have VirusTotal scan results for the suspicious domain.

VIRUSTOTAL DATA:
{{ JSON.stringify($json, null, 2) }}

Based on this external threat intelligence, provide your FINAL assessment:
- Did VirusTotal confirm it's malicious?
- Should we change the threat score?
- What's your final recommendation?

Respond in JSON:
{
  "finalThreatScore": 0-100,
  "virusTotalVerdict": "Confirmed malicious / Clean / Suspicious",
  "finalRecommendation": "Block|Quarantine|Allow",
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}
```

**Example Output**:
```json
{
  "finalThreatScore": 15,
  "virusTotalVerdict": "Clean",
  "finalRecommendation": "Allow",
  "reasoning": "VirusTotal scan shows 0/95 engines flagged as malicious. Domain registered in 1996 with legitimate SSL. Initial HIGH RISK was due to suspicious email characteristics, but domain itself is not compromised."
}
```

**Why This Step Is Critical**:
This demonstrates **agent-like reasoning** where the AI:
1. **Recalls Context**: References its previous analysis
2. **Incorporates New Data**: Integrates VirusTotal findings
3. **Updates Beliefs**: Can change its assessment based on evidence
4. **Explains Changes**: Shows what led to the new conclusion

**Real-World Example from Testing**:
- Initial Assessment: 85/100 (HIGH RISK - suspicious email)
- VirusTotal Result: 0/95 malicious flags
- Final Assessment: 15/100 (LOW RISK - legitimate domain, email filtering only)
- **The AI changed its mind based on facts!**

## 📊 Workflow Breakdown

### Full Execution Flow

#### Step 1: Email Ingestion (Every 5 minutes)

1. Schedule trigger fires
2. n8n calls Gmail API
3. Fetches up to 10 unread emails
4. Gmail returns structured JSON for each email

**Processing Time**: ~2-3 seconds per batch

---

#### Step 2: Initial AI Analysis

For each email:

1. Email data passed to Claude via Anthropic API
2. Claude analyzes:
   - Sender legitimacy
   - Subject line tactics
   - Body content for social engineering
   - URL patterns
   - Urgency indicators
3. Generates threat score (0-100)
4. Returns JSON with indicators and recommendation

**Processing Time**: ~3-5 seconds per email

**AI Reasoning Process**:
```
1. Parse email structure and metadata
2. Extract all URLs and domains
3. Identify urgency language ("24 hours", "immediate action")
4. Check for sender/domain mismatches
5. Assess request legitimacy (password resets, verifications)
6. Calculate weighted threat score
7. Generate human-readable explanation
```

---

#### Step 3: Risk-Based Routing

1. IF node receives Claude's response text
2. Searches for string `"riskLevel": "HIGH"`
3. Routes to appropriate branch:
   - **TRUE**: Proceed to enrichment
   - **FALSE**: Archive or log (end workflow)

**Why This Matters**: Only high-risk emails consume VirusTotal API quota, optimizing resource usage.

---

#### Step 4: External Enrichment (HIGH RISK only)

1. Extract domain from Claude's analysis
2. HTTP Request to VirusTotal API
3. VirusTotal scans domain against 95+ engines
4. Returns reputation data and malicious flags

**What VirusTotal Checks**:
- Antivirus engine detections
- WHOIS registration data
- SSL certificate validity
- Historical threat activity
- Community reputation scores

**Processing Time**: ~2-4 seconds per domain

---

#### Step 5: Final AI Re-Assessment

1. Claude receives:
   - Original email data (context)
   - Initial threat assessment (previous analysis)
   - VirusTotal scan results (new evidence)

2. Claude performs synthesis:
   - Compares initial suspicions with hard data
   - Identifies false positives (legitimate domains)
   - Confirms true positives (malicious confirmed)
   - Adjusts threat score based on evidence

3. Generates final verdict with updated reasoning

**Example Reasoning**:
```
Initial: "Suspicious domain, urgency tactics → 85/100"
After VT: "Domain clean (0/95 flags), registered 1996 → 15/100"
Verdict: "Email suspicious but domain legitimate → Allow with caution"
```

**Processing Time**: ~3-5 seconds

---

#### Step 6: Reporting (Optional - Can Be Extended)

Current implementation can:
- Generate HTML reports with threat details
- Email alerts to SOC team
- Log to database for analytics
- Create JIRA/ServiceNow tickets
